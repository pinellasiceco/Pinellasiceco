# Pinellas Ice Co — App Status
*Last updated: 2026-05-07 (session 16b — login screen fix) by Claude Code*

## Live App
- URL: https://pinellasiceco.github.io/Pinellasiceco
- Last deployed: 2026-05-07 (session 16 — Supabase Auth + real-time sync + cloud data migration)
- Build script: `build.py` (repo root) → outputs `index.html` directly
- `index.html` regenerated from `build.py` using existing P[] data — fully in sync

## What's Working ✅

### Deployment
- Daily cron: `0 11 * * *` (7am ET) in `rebuild.yml`
- Commit uses `--allow-empty` — always pushes even if no data changes
- `pages.yml` deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to main
- `send_briefing.py` runs as **final step in rebuild.yml** — always sends after fresh data is built
- Daily briefing fallback: `send_briefing.yml` cron at 13:00 UTC (9am ET) if rebuild fails
- sw.js cache bumped manually when patching index.html; `build.py` auto-stamps on CI rebuild

### Navigation
- 6-tab layout: Home / Prospects / Pipeline / Route / Clients / Partners
- Gear ⚙️ button opens Settings overlay
- `sw('customers')` and `sw('service')` alias to Clients tab (backward compatible)
- Clients tab has inner sub-tabs: Clients / Service (via `setClientTab()`)

### Home Tab
- **TODAY'S PLAN** section at top: ranked action list (action score = urgency × revenue × recency × ice risk boost), max 8 stops
- **Add All to Route** button in TODAY'S PLAN adds all stops and switches to Route tab
- Strike Zone section shows top-scored prospects by city cluster
- In Play follow-ups grouped by urgency: Overdue / Today / This Week / This Month
- Cold targets grid loads on first open
- **New Since Yesterday** section: split into 🚨 Urgent / ⚠️ Watch / ℹ️ Info tiers based on `change_severity` field baked at CI build time

### Prospects Tab
- Full prospect list with search/filter
- showCard detail overlay:
  - All buttons use `data-action` / `data-id` + event delegation on modal backdrop (iOS-safe)
  - Pitch/walkin/objection scripts removed
  - ATP Status Report button (📋 Report) opens print-ready leave-behind
  - Follow-up: standard `input[type=date]` pre-filled with existing date if set
  - Save button: large "Save & Disposition Lead" button, always saves (no blocking)
  - Missing follow-up on in_play/not_now shows soft toast tip, does not block

### Route Tab
- ZIP always syncs from Settings on load (no stale value)
- **City cluster chips**: Tarpon / Palm Harbor / Dunedin / Clearwater / Largo / Safety Harbor / St. Pete / All — sets ZIP + triggers rRoute()
- Manual mode: explicit green **➕ Add** / orange **✓ Added** toggle buttons per card with inline `ontouchend` — fires reliably on iOS PWA
- Manual mode displays hint text explaining how to build route
- Card body tap opens Details; only the Add button adds to route (no accidental adds)
- Optimized build available (hours input triggers TSP routing)
- Anchor stop supported (`routeAnchor` / `clearAnchor()`)
- Start 📍 button also uses inline `ontouchend` for iOS reliability

### Pipeline Tab
- 4-stage tab UI: **In Play / Quoted / Won / Lost** (via `setPipeStage()` / `pipeStage` state)
- KPI bar: In Play count, Quoted count, Close Rate %
- `getProspectStage(p)` classifies each prospect by stage (checks p.status + last log outcome)
- In Play / Quoted: grouped by follow-up urgency (Overdue / Today / Week / Month / Later)
- Won / Lost: chronological list with outcome badge
- Ice risk badges (High/Med) shown on In Play / Quoted cards
- Lost `not_now` (Timing) auto-resurfaces after 90 days (not shown in Lost)
- Quoted outcome button in showCard logs `quoted` as first-class outcome; shows "📄 Moved to Pipeline → Quoted" toast and navigates to Quoted stage
- Pipeline cards (`.dc`) have `data-id` + `ontouchend` for iOS tap reliability; also handled in global IIFE
- **Forward-only disposition rules** (`getBlockedOutcomes(p)`): outcome buttons grey out with 🔒 when move would regress stage; Lost prospects get 🔄 Re-engage button to move back to In Play

### Clients Tab
- MRR/ARR calculated from recurring customers (`kpi-mrr`, `kpi-arr`)
- Filter by account status: Recurring / One-Time / Intro / Quoted / Churned
- Client card service row: **Email Report only** (Log Visit + Set Next Due removed — use Service sub-tab)
- `churnClient(id)` marks prospect churned with confirm dialog; red Churn button on non-churned cards
- Service sub-tab: log service visits, track next service date, machine info
- Save Service Visit button: iOS-safe (`onclick` + `ontouchend`)

### ATP Status Report
- `scStatusReport(p)` opens ATP input overlay from showCard; persists entered ATP value + notes to `atp_history` before generating PDF/email
- `srGenerate(p, atpVal, notes)` generates print-ready letter-size HTML report; shows amber STATUS CHANGE banner if ATP label (PASS/MARGINAL/FAIL) differs from previous visit
- `srSendEmail(p, atpVal, emailTo, notes)` emails same report via proxy; same status change banner logic
- Scale: ≤0 = PENDING, ≤10 = PASS, 11–100 = MARGINAL, >100 = FAIL
- `atp_history` entries: `{date, pre, post, notes}` — notes field populated by both `submitServiceLog` and `scStatusReport`
- Pop-up blocker fallback toast if `window.open` is blocked
- 3-button layout: Cancel / 📧 Email / Print
- Print CSS: `@page { margin: 0.3in }`, `zoom: 0.92`, padding reduced — guaranteed 1-page output on iOS and desktop

### showCard Detail Overlay
- **WHY THIS PROSPECT MATTERS** navy intel panel (`buildIntelSummary(p)`) — shows ice violations, callback count, inspection timeline, machine count, risk level
- **Ice risk badges** (🧊 High Risk / 🧊 Med Risk) in chips row
- **Quoted** outcome button (purple) added alongside In Play / Intro Set
- All buttons: iOS-safe inline `ontouchend` + `onclick`

### Ice Compliance Risk Score
- `calc_ice_risk(record)` Python function bakes `ice_risk_prob` (0–100), `ice_risk_level` (Low/Med/High), `ice_risk_reason` into every P[] record
- Factors: ice violations <6mo (+25), total ice violations (×8), callbacks (×15), chronic flag (+15), days since inspection (+5/10), machine count (+4/8), business type keywords (+6)
- High ≥65, Medium ≥35, Low <35
- Ice risk boosts action score in TODAY'S PLAN: High=1.4×, Medium=1.2×

### Email System
- **Proxy required**: Resend blocks browser-direct calls (CORS 403) — all email goes through Supabase Edge Function
- Edge Function: `supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts` — deployed via GitHub Actions (`deploy_edge_functions.yml`)
- App setting: `pic_email_fn_url` (localStorage) = Edge Function URL; set in Settings → Cloud Sync
- App setting: `pic_supabase_key` (localStorage) = Supabase anon key (used as Bearer token)
- `sendEmailViaProxy(to, subject, html)` — central send function used by all email buttons
- Email buttons on: ATP report overlay, service report preview, customer card (compliance summary), service log row
- Customer email address stored in `customers[id].email` via `saveCustomerEmail()`
- `emailServiceReport(id)` — emails rendered report HTML from `#report-content`
- `emailComplianceReport(id)` — emails compliance summary (last service, ATP, machine, next due) + technician notes from most recent `atp_history` entry
- **Deploy**: any change to `supabase/functions/**` on main auto-triggers `deploy_edge_functions.yml`

### Date Handling
- `localISO(d)` helper returns `YYYY-MM-DD` in device local timezone
- All 23 date storage sites use `localISO()` — no UTC off-by-one after 8pm ET
- Prospect follow-up dates: stored as local ISO string, compared correctly

## What's Broken / Watch List ⚠️

- **iPad copy-paste**: copying code blocks from chat on iPad adds angle brackets around URLs. Never paste code directly into Supabase editor — use the GitHub Actions deploy workflow instead.

If something appears broken, first try force-closing the PWA and reopening — the sw.js cache bust (`pic-YYYYMMDD`) requires a full app restart on iOS to take effect.

To force a fresh PWA load after a push: open the URL directly in Safari (not the home screen icon), wait for page to load fully, then the home screen icon will serve the updated version.

### Channel Partners Tab (session 11)
- 6th tab: &#x1F91D; Partners — channel partner prospect management
- **Python pipeline** (`build.py`): `classify_partner()`, `build_partner_records()` — keyword detection on FL DBPR contractor license CSV (if downloaded) + fallback seed list; bakes `PARTNERS[]` into HTML at CI rebuild time
- **Data**: `PARTNERS[]` static array in HTML, merged at runtime with `localStorage` overrides (`pic_partners_v1`)
- **Filter chips**: by partner type (Hood / Pest / Refrig / HVAC / Beverage) and status (Not Contacted / Active / In Conversation)
- **KPI bar**: Total Prospects · Active Partners · Fees Owed (3 columns)
- **Partner card** → detail overlay: status dropdown, notes textarea, phone/email links, referral list, "Copy Email" / "Log Outreach" buttons
- **Close Deal integration**: active partner dropdown in Close Deal overlay; `logPartnerReferral()` records referral + calculates tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- **Payout report**: downloads `.txt` file listing all fees owed by partner
- **Add Partner** button: manually add any business not in seed list
- **Daily briefing**: `send_briefing.py` includes top 5 not-contacted partners in email
- **CI**: `download_data.py` tries 3 DBPR contractor CSV URLs to populate `data/partner_licenses.csv`
- **sw.js**: bumped to `pic-20260430a`

## What's Missing 🔲
- Nothing from the current feature roadmap is missing

## Recent Changes
- **2026-05-07 (s16b):** Fix login screen not appearing. Root cause: `build_html()` replaces ALL `%%SUPABASE_URL%%` occurrences in the HTML template, including the guard checks inside `initSupabase()` like `_SUPABASE_URL!=='%%SUPABASE_URL%%'`. After replacement this became `_SUPABASE_URL!=='https://actual-url'` — always false — so `url` always fell through to localStorage (empty), `initSupabase()` returned null, and the app silently entered demo mode with no login screen. Fixed all 7 occurrences across `initSupabase()`, `updateSyncDot()`, `sendEmailViaProxy()`, `exportToBriefing()` in both `build.py` and `index.html`. Simple truthy check now: `var url=_SUPABASE_URL||localStorage.getItem('pic_supabase_url')||''`. Added `console.log('Supabase initialized: <url>')`, `console.log('No session found — showing login screen')`, `console.warn('Running without Supabase — demo mode')` for diagnostics.
- **2026-05-07 (s16):** Full cloud migration — Supabase Auth + magic link login + real-time sync. `initSupabase()` bootstraps from baked-in credentials (replaced by `build_html()` at CI time). `init()` is now async: checks auth session, shows `showLoginScreen()` if none, listens for `onAuthStateChange`. `loadCloudData()` loads all data from Supabase tables with localStorage fallback as offline cache. `subscribeRealtime()` subscribes to `pic_log` + `pic_customers` postgres_changes for live cross-device sync. `lSave()` / `custSave()` / `phSave()` now write to Supabase via `sbUpsert()` in addition to localStorage. Python `push_to_supabase()` pushes P[] and PARTNERS[] to Supabase at CI build time. `rebuild.yml` passes new secrets to build step. Settings overlay shows logged-in email + Sign Out button. Offline/demo mode preserved: if Supabase not configured, login screen skipped and app uses localStorage. 75/75 tests passing. sw.js bumped to `pic-20260507c`. **Requires Supabase SQL setup + 4 GitHub Secrets before login flow works** — see Next Session Priorities.
- **2026-05-07 (s15 patch):** Fix button in churn-risk widget now calls `navigateToClientService(id)` — switches to Clients tab, opens Service sub-tab, smooth-scrolls to `#svc-card-{id}` with 2s red outline highlight. Each `.svc-card` now has `id="svc-card-{p.id}"`. iOS `ontouchend` on Fix button. sw.js bumped to `pic-20260507b`.
- **2026-05-07 (s15):** Four fixes — (1) FIX 1: `normO()` was mapping `'quoted'` → `'in_play'`, breaking `getProspectStage()` so prospects never appeared in Pipeline → Quoted. Removed that mapping; `quoted` is now a first-class outcome with its own OI label ("Quote Sent ✓") and colour. Logging Quoted shows "📄 Moved to Pipeline → Quoted" toast and navigates to that stage. (2) FIX 2: `getBlockedOutcomes(p)` enforces forward-only stage progression — outcome buttons grey with 🔒 when a move would regress stage; Lost prospects get a dedicated 🔄 Re-engage button. (3) FIX 3: Pipeline `.dc` cards get `data-id` + `ontouchend`; Route "Details"/"Remove" buttons and Client "Details" button get `ontouchend`; global IIFE extended to handle `.dc[data-id]` taps — all reliable on iOS Safari. (4) FIX 4: Python `classify_change()` adds `change_severity` field (urgent/warning/info) to every P[] record. Home tab New Since Yesterday splits into 🚨 Urgent / ⚠️ Watch / ℹ️ Info sub-sections. `send_briefing.py` email restructured identically, subject line leads with urgent count. sw.js bumped to `pic-20260507a`; 75/75 tests passing.
- **2026-05-06 (s14):** Three bug fixes — (1) FIX 1: `emailComplianceReport` now reads technician notes from `service_history` (primary) with `atp_history.notes` fallback, so notes logged during visits appear in compliance PDF and email body; (2) FIX 2: `renderServiceCal` now shows all active customer statuses (`customer_recurring`, `customer_quarterly`, `customer_once`, `customer_intro`) — new clients appear in Service tab immediately after Close Deal, with plan type badge (Monthly/Quarterly/One-Time/Intro) in card subtitle; (3) FIX 3: Partner seed list expanded from 5 to 43 Pinellas County businesses across all 5 categories (10 hood cleaning, 9 pest control, 8 refrigeration, 7 beverage equipment, 7 HVAC) with real phone numbers and addresses; session-13 JS fixes backported to `build.py` so CI rebuilds don't regress them; sw.js bumped to `pic-20260506b`
- **2026-05-06 (s13):** Compliance PDF notes & ATP status change detection — `atp_history.push` now includes `notes` field so repeat inspections of existing locations persist technician notes; `emailComplianceReport` reads notes from most recent `atp_history` entry and appends to email body; `srGenerate`/`srSendEmail` detect PASS/MARGINAL/FAIL status changes between consecutive visits and show amber ⚠ STATUS CHANGE banner; `scStatusReport` persists entered ATP value and notes back to `atp_history` before dispatching PDF/email so subsequent compliance emails can retrieve them; UA test suite remains 75 passed, 0 failed
- **2026-05-05 (s12):** 18 bug fixes — quarterly plan schedule, prevent re-close on won deals, churn button gating, remove Signed/Service Done buttons, partner Log Outreach modal wiring, Add All to Route 8-stop limit with skipMax param, one-time clean sets `customer_once`, emailComplianceReport reuses srSendEmail HTML output, sendEmailViaProxy returns true/false, ATP notes field in report, hide dead prospects toggle (`_showDead`/`toggleShowDead()`), Supabase input onblur/onchange + Save Credentials button + sync dot indicator, filter bar overflow-x scroll, full-width purple Quoted button in showCard, partner contact fields (name/role/phone/email/address), generateICS() calendar export for quarterly clients
- **2026-04-30 (s11c):** Bug fixes — (1) Supabase URL + key inputs added to Settings panel so `sendEmailViaProxy()` and `exportToBriefing()` can be configured from UI; (2) ATP PDF guaranteed 1-page via `@page{margin:0.3in}` + `zoom:0.92` + tighter element spacing; (3) Close deal MRR fix: `rCust()` now reads `customers[p.id].monthly` (actual closed price) instead of `p.monthly` (DBPR estimate), and `scMarkWon()` syncs `p.monthly`/`p.machines` back to P[] for consistency; (4) Daily briefing JSON parse fix: `load_current()` delimiter changed to `';\nconst PARTNERS='` so trailing semicolon is excluded from the `json.loads()` slice; duplicate `main()` in build.py removed
- **2026-04-30 (s11b):** Partner Fit Score — `calc_partner_fit_score()` auto-scores 0-100 from type, years in business, review count, rating, food service focus, geography, website; `scrape_website_keywords()` caches to `data/partner_web_cache.json`; fit score badge on partner cards; fit score breakdown in detail overlay; "Best to Contact First" top-5 section; sort by fit score; daily briefing shows top 3 by score; sw.js bumped to `pic-20260430b`
- **2026-04-30 (s11):** Channel Partner Program — Partners tab, partner detection pipeline, referral attribution, payout report, daily briefing integration
- **2026-04-29 (s10):** Email/Supabase restored — `srSendEmail()`, `emailServiceReport()`, `emailComplianceReport()`, `sendEmailViaProxy()`, `exportToBriefing()`, `saveEmailFnUrl()`, `sb-email-fn` input, Daily Briefing section with export button — were missing from manually-patched s9 index.html; fixed by regenerating index.html directly from build.py
- **2026-04-29 (s10):** Pricing v2 — `est_deep_clean` now per-machine ($395 + $149 each additional, standalone no-plan); `calc_year1(plan, machines)` Python function; `year1_monthly` + `year1_quarterly` baked into P[]; `calcOnetime()` + `calcYear1()` JS functions; factRows updated with "Filters NOT included"; ATP CTA "$99 to start · Annual plans from $129/mo"
- **2026-04-29 (s10):** Close Deal overlay v2 — machine +/− spinner, editable entry price field ($99 default), live Year 1 Total Value display ($entry + $monthly × 12), "Use $X one-time instead" link at bottom; `coAdjMachines()`, `coUpdateEntry()`, `coUseOnetime()` functions added; `scMarkWon(onetime)` stores `entry_price`, `entry_discount`, `filters_included:false` to customer record
- **2026-04-29 (s10):** Service schedule intervals fixed — monthly plan: 60-day intervals (was 61); quarterly plan: 90-day intervals (was 91); maintenance type `maintenance_61`→`maintenance_60`, label `61-Day`→`60-Day`
- **2026-04-29 (s10):** sw.js bumped to `pic-20260429b`

- **2026-04-29 (s9):** Close Deal overlay — single 🤝 Close Deal button → modal with Monthly/Quarterly toggle + $99 intro checkbox; `scOpenClose()`, `updateCloseDisplay()`, `scMarkWon()`; Lost moved to confirm() dialog
- **2026-04-29 (s9):** buildAnnualSchedule quarterly — monthly=6 visits/61-day, quarterly=4 visits/91-day; deep cleans at visits 1+4 (monthly) or 1+3 (quarterly); all contracts renew at 1 year
- **2026-04-29 (s9):** Golf course detection — `GOLF_KEYWORDS`, `is_golf_venue()`, `venue_type` field baked into P[]; golf floors machines at 2, +10 score bonus; ⛳ Golf filter chip in Prospects; ⛳ Golf cluster chip in Route tab; golf badge in cards + showCard; F&B Director default in contact role dropdown
- **2026-04-29 (s9):** WHY THIS PROSPECT MATTERS — added to index.html (was missing from s8 patch); includes golf intel line; ice risk chips added to showCard chips row
- **2026-04-29 (s9):** Pricing displays — showCard factRows updated (quarterly, annual commitment language); ATP CTA "Annual plans from $129/mo · Annual commitment · Cancel anytime after year 1"; removed all "no commitment" language
- **2026-04-29 (s9):** Daily email fix — `send_briefing.py` embedded as final step in `rebuild.yml` (GitHub bot pushes never trigger other workflows, so the push trigger was never firing); `send_briefing.yml` cron moved to 13:00 UTC as true fallback

- **2026-04-27 (s7):** Supabase Edge Function `send-email` — CORS-safe proxy for Resend API (browser cannot call Resend directly); deployed via GitHub Actions
- **2026-04-27 (s7):** Daily briefing reliability — decoupled from `rebuild.yml` into dedicated `send_briefing.yml` triggered on push to main (fixes silent cron failure on low-activity repos)
- **2026-04-27 (s7):** `deploy_edge_functions.yml` — auto-deploys Edge Functions from repo; eliminates need to copy-paste code into Supabase dashboard

## Cloud / Auth Architecture (session 16)

### Login Flow
- `initSupabase()` — creates Supabase client from baked-in `_SUPABASE_URL` / `_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (replaced at CI build time); falls back to localStorage `pic_supabase_url` / `pic_supabase_key`
- `init()` — async, auth-first: checks session → shows login screen if none → listens for `onAuthStateChange` → on SIGNED_IN loads cloud data + subscribes realtime
- `showLoginScreen()` — full-screen navy overlay with ice cube emoji, email input, "Send Magic Link" button; `addEventListener` pattern (iOS-safe)
- `hideLoginScreen()` — removes overlay, restores `#app` display
- `showLoadingScreen(msg)` / `hideLoadingScreen()` — navy loading overlay shown during `loadCloudData()`
- Magic link redirect: `access_token` in URL hash handled automatically by Supabase JS client; URL cleaned with `history.replaceState`
- Settings overlay shows "✓ Logged in as email@..." + **Sign Out** button when `_userId` is set

### Data Loading (`loadCloudData()`)
- Loads in order: pic_prospects → pic_partners → pic_log → pic_customers → pic_phones → pic_settings → pic_partner_data
- Prospects: if Supabase row exists, replaces embedded `P[]` array; otherwise falls back to embedded data from build
- All loaded data also written to localStorage as offline cache

### Real-time Sync (`subscribeRealtime()`)
- Channel: `pic-changes-{userId}` with `postgres_changes` listeners on `pic_log` and `pic_customers`
- On change: updates in-memory `log`/`customers`, re-renders active tab, flashes `sync-dot`, writes to localStorage cache
- `sync-dot` turns green when realtime `SUBSCRIBED`, amber on reconnect

### Save Functions
- `lSave()` — writes to localStorage + calls `sbUpsert('pic_log', pid, data)` for each pid if logged in
- `custSave()` — writes to localStorage + calls `sbUpsert('pic_customers', pid, data)` if logged in
- `phSave()` — writes to localStorage + calls `sbUpsert('pic_phones', id, data)` if logged in
- `sbUpsert(table, prospectId, data)` — upserts with `{user_id, prospect_id, data, updated_at}` using `onConflict:'user_id,prospect_id'`

### Build Pipeline (CI)
- `push_to_supabase(table, data)` Python function at end of `main()` pushes `records` → `pic_prospects` and `partners` → `pic_partners`
- `build_html()` replaces `%%SUPABASE_URL%%` and `%%SUPABASE_ANON_KEY%%` from env vars
- `rebuild.yml` passes `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_USER_ID` to build step

### GitHub Secrets Required
| Secret | Where to find |
|--------|--------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase → Settings → API |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase → Settings → API (public anon key) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Supabase → Settings → API (service_role key) |
| `SUPABASE_USER_ID` | `select id from auth.users` after first login |

### Supabase SQL to Run (one-time setup)
See the SQL in the prompt — creates `pic_prospects`, `pic_partners`, adds `user_id` column to existing tables, enables RLS, creates `own_*` policies. Enable realtime on `pic_log` and `pic_customers` in Supabase dashboard → Database → Replication.

### Offline / Demo Mode
- If Supabase is not configured (no URL/key in env or localStorage), app runs in local-only mode — login screen is skipped, localStorage data used directly. Zero regression for existing usage.

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Supabase setup**: Run the SQL from the prompt in Supabase SQL Editor; enable realtime on `pic_log` + `pic_customers`; add 4 GitHub Secrets (`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_USER_ID`)
2. **First login test**: Open app → confirm login screen appears; enter email → confirm magic link email received; tap link → confirm app loads with data
3. **Real-time test**: Open on iPhone + iPad simultaneously; log outcome on one → confirm it appears on the other within 2 seconds
4. **CI rebuild**: Trigger manual rebuild → confirm `pic_prospects` row updated in Supabase SQL Editor

## iOS PWA Rules (never violate these)
- **Buttons in injected HTML:** use inline `ontouchend="event.preventDefault();fn()"` + `onclick="fn()"` — NOT `addEventListener` on innerHTML-injected elements
- **Delegation modals (showCard):** `addEventListener` on the backdrop element AFTER `document.createElement` + `appendChild` — never on innerHTML content
- **`event.stopPropagation()`** on nested buttons inside delegated containers to prevent parent card handler from also firing
- **No** `addEventListener` on elements injected via `innerHTML` — attach AFTER `appendChild`
- **Dates:** always `localISO(d)` for storage, `parseLD(s)` for parsing — never `toISOString().slice(0,10)`
- **SW cache:** `build.py` auto-stamps `pic-YYYYMMDD`; after manual edits to sw.js, bump manually
- **iOS PWA cache refresh:** requires full app kill + reopen — sw update not immediate

## Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `build.py` | **Edit this** — generates prospecting_tool.html; also stamps sw.js cache date |
| `index.html` | Deployed output — keep in sync with build.py; overwritten by CI daily |
| `sw.js` | Service worker — auto date-stamped by build.py; bump manually after direct edits |
